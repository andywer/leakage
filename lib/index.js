/*
 * Disclaimer:
 *
 * The code in this file is quite ugly. Usually in a review I would be very
 * unhappy if I saw something like this.
 * But it's not this code's job to look pleasant. It's job is to create heap
 * diffs while leaving the smallest possible heap footprint itself. To achieve
 * that we do a couple of things:
 *
 * - We create all objects (including functions and arrays) as early as possible
 *   and only once
 * - We create arrays using the `Array` constructor and pass the size we need
 *   to avoid re-allocations
 * - We never assign values of different types (number, object, ...) to a variable
 * - We try to avoid promises whereever possible, since they come with a big
 *   heap footprint
 * - We use setImmediate() in the right places to create a new execution context
 *   to allow garbage-collecting the old execution context's objects
 * - We have dedicated heap footprint tests (see `test/heap-footprint.test.js`)
 *   and we test if changes to this code alter its heap footprint
